# Rockbuster Stealth SQL Analysis
# Project Summary

This project presents a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of Rockbuster Stealth’s business data to support the company’s 2020 strategy. The analysis addresses key strategic questions from the management board, including top and low revenue-generating movies, average rental durations, customer locations, lifetime value segments, and regional sales variations.

Using PostgreSQL, I designed and executed SQL queries to extract and analyze patterns across Rockbuster’s database. The insights were then visualized in Tableau, transforming raw data into clear, actionable business intelligence. This project demonstrates not only SQL technical skills but also the ability to translate data into strategic recommendations relevant across industries.

# Key Questions & Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board required data-driven answers to guide their strategy:

Which movies generated the highest and lowest revenue?

What was the average rental duration across all films?

In which countries are Rockbuster’s customers located?

Where are high lifetime-value customers based?

Do sales figures differ across regions?

# Data & Tools

The analysis was performed using Rockbuster’s relational database in PostgreSQL. The dataset included information on inventory, films, actors, customers, staff, stores, rentals, payments, and addresses.

## Tools used: 
pgAdmin 4, PostgreSQL, Tableau Public
